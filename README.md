This is a script for the game Space Engineers. It is to be used with an in-game LCD and a set of three buttons for controlling the movements and navigating settings. <br />
This script is capable of: <br />
Performing all chess game mechanics - standard moves, castling, en passant, promotions, etc. <br />
Auto-detecting wins and draws of all types, <br />
Mid-game player communication (takebacks, draw offers, resignations, extending time), <br />
Customization (different in-game sounds, rotating the board, animation speeds and types, event times), <br />
Displaying of chess notation, <br />
Serialization (saving) of data during and after the chess game has been finished upon exiting the game, <br />
CRUD operations of chess games except 'update' - You can save, delete, review and analyse saved games. <br />
